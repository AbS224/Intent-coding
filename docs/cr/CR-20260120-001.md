# Change Request: CR-20260120-001
**Status:** DRAFT (Awaiting Implementation)
**Title:** Initialization of Intent-AST Parser Core
**Component:** crucible-core (Rust)

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
The Crucible Engine requires a formal structure to translate natural language "Intents" into verifiable logic. Without a structured Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), the "Correct by Design" directive cannot be formally proven.

## 2. INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Target Intent:** `logic_foundation.v1.ast_parser`
- **Goal:** Create a high-rigor Rust enum-based AST that represents all valid engineering operations.
- **Constraints:** Must be serializable (Serde) and compatible with Z3 formal verification hooks.

## 3. ENGINEERING SPECIFICATION
- **Core Logic:** Define `enum IntentNode` to handle `Requirement`, `Constraint`, and `Proof` types.
- **No-Mock Policy:** Implementation must interface directly with the Rust `syn` crate or custom lexer; no placeholder stubs allowed.
- **Security:** Ensure memory safety via Rust's ownership model (no `unsafe` blocks).

## 4. MIL-SPEC ARTIFACTS
- [ ] SRS Updated: Define AST node types.
- [ ] SDD Updated: Document the tree traversal architecture.
- [ ] STP Updated: Test cases for logical circular dependencies.

## 5. VERIFICATION PLAN
- Run `cargo test` on logic modules.
- Verify node depth limits to prevent stack overflow in recursive parsing.
