## Technical Content


### Security Architecture

#### Threat Model
- **Adversarial Requirements**: Malicious input designed to break verification
- **Proof Tampering**: Attempts to modify mathematical proofs
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Information leakage through timing/power
- **Quantum Attacks**: Future quantum computer threats

#### Security Controls

##### Authentication and Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication mandatory
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews

##### Cryptographic Implementation
- Post-quantum cryptography (ML-KEM/ML-DSA)
- Perfect forward secrecy
- Cryptographic agility for algorithm updates
- Hardware security module (HSM) integration

##### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Key rotation every 90 days
- Secure key derivation (PBKDF2)

### Security Testing

#### Penetration Testing
- Quarterly external assessments
- Continuous automated scanning
- Red team exercises
- Vulnerability disclosure program

#### Code Security
- Static analysis (SAST)
- Dynamic analysis (DAST)
- Dependency scanning
- Secure code review

### Incident Response

#### Response Team
- Security Officer (Lead)
- Technical Lead
- Compliance Officer
- External forensics (if needed)

#### Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts
2. **Analysis**: Threat assessment and containment
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review
