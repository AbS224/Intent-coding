## Publications & Preprints

### 2024

**"Vibecoding: From Natural Language to Formally Verified Code"**  
*Adam B. Straughn*  
*Preprint available at: [verifiableproof.systems/papers/vibecoding-2024.pdf]*  
**Abstract**: This paper introduces the concept of "vibecoding" - a methodology for transforming informal, natural language requirements into formally verified, production-ready code through a multi-stage AI-assisted verification pipeline. We present the Crucible Engine architecture and demonstrate its effectiveness on safety-critical system specifications.

**"Multi-Agent Adversarial Verification for AI-Generated Code"**  
*Adam B. Straughn*  
*Preprint available at: [verifiableproof.systems/papers/thunderdome-2024.pdf]*  
**Abstract**: We propose a novel approach to verifying AI-generated code using adversarial multi-agent systems. The "Thunderdome" architecture employs competing AI agents to identify logical flaws and security vulnerabilities in automatically generated specifications and implementations.

**"Post-Quantum Audit Trails for Formal Verification Systems"**  
*Adam B. Straughn*  
*Preprint available at: [verifiableproof.systems/papers/pq-audit-2024.pdf]*  
**Abstract**: This work presents a framework for creating tamper-evident, quantum-resistant audit trails for formal verification processes. We demonstrate the integration of ML-KEM and ML-DSA signatures with immutable verification records for regulatory compliance.

**"Verifiable Proof Systems and the Mitigation of Narrative-Driven AI Perception Gaps"**  
*Adam B. Straughn*  
*Preprint available at: [verifiableproof.systems/papers/ai-perception-gaps-2024.pdf]*  
**Abstract**: This research demonstrates that AI adoption barriers in regulated industries stem primarily from perception gaps rooted in science fiction narratives and linguistic ambiguity. Through a 100-participant study, we show that verifiable proof systems increase perceived reliability by 34%, reduce decision time by 22%, and improve comprehension accuracy by 18%.

### 2023

**"Intent-AST: A Formal Representation for Natural Language Requirements"**  
*Adam B. Straughn*  
*Preprint available at: [verifiableproof.systems/papers/intent-ast-2023.pdf]*  
**Abstract**: We introduce Intent-AST, a formal abstract syntax tree representation for capturing the semantic content of natural language system requirements. This representation enables automated dependency analysis, gap detection, and formal verification of system specifications.

**"Tree-Sitter Grammars for Requirement Engineering"**  
*Adam B. Straughn*  
*Preprint available at: [verifiableproof.systems/papers/treesitter-req-2023.pdf]*  
**Abstract**: This paper presents specialized Tree-Sitter grammars for parsing and analyzing natural language requirements in software engineering contexts. We demonstrate improved accuracy in requirement extraction and structural analysis compared to traditional NLP approaches.
